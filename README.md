 # Project 0

Please start with the file `Python_Tutorial.tex`
- It is a LaTeX file; LaTeX is a document markup language. 
- If you've never used LaTeX before, then there are instructions right at the top of this file for how to compile this .tex file into a PDF.
- We strongly recommend using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) for turning LaTeX files into PDFs.

Then, move onto the `Project0_Template.tex` and work through those questions.

To submit the project, you can compile `Project0_Template.tex` into a PDF and upload it to Gradescope.

 
Let us know if you run into any problems!
